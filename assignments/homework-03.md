# Homework 3

See Moodle for the due date.

There is a file in the course repository `assignments/guestbook.md`. Fork the
course repository on GitHub, create a branch, and add some kind of content to
this file. See the instructions at the top of that document for inspiration.

Once you've done this, commit your changes (remember to write a good commit
message) and open a "Pull Request" (PR) on the main GitHub repository. In the PR
description, include a one-sentence description of your change.

Submit the link to your PR on Moodle.
