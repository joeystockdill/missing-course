# Homework 1

See Moodle for the due date.

Let's wrangle some data with Sed! We're going to do something fun, modifying a
small Python program, just to demonstrate some of the power this tool brings to
the table.

Download the [template script](homework-01.sh) and modify as described in the
comments. You'll also need a [source code file](homework-01.py).

Once you've finished, submit the script only (do not compress it or attempt to
include the source code and data files) through Moodle.

There isn't necessarily one correct answer, so feel free to use Google or man
pages (remember `man <command>`).
