# Homework 2

See Moodle for the due date.

Log into the "missing" server. See the second lecture on Remote Computing if you
need to brush up on how to do this. There should be a file in your home
directory (the directory you end up in after logging in) called `hello.txt`.
Submit the contents of this file on Moodle to get credit for the assignment.

Once you have done that, create a new file in your home directory called
`hi.txt`. You can include any content you want in this file, it just has to have
the correct filename.
