# Graduate Project

Graduate students, or anyone taking this course at the 400 level, will need to
complete a significant project that demonstrates understanding of the course
content. Students should propose a project and may begin working on it once it
has been approved by the instructor.

If you are currently involved in research, it is a good idea to choose a project
that complements that work. The same is true if you are in a capstone or other
project-centric class. You shouldn't plan to hand in the same project you've
done elsewhere, but if you can make them complement one another then you'll get
more out of both (and they will be less work for you).

Take a look at the list of [topics](../topics/) if you need inspiration.

## Project Scope

Your project should be decidedly non-trivial. The expectation is that it should
take around 40 hours of focussed effort on your part.

For example, a graduate student who has developed a software package for a
research project might decide to add a test suite to their package; this would
likely include all of the following:

  - Unit tests using an appropriate library
  - Functional tests using shell scripts
  - Test isolation using Docker container
  - Performance regression tests using an appropriate tool
  - Continuous integration to ensure tests are run

The above represent a significant body of work that would benefit the student's
project and call upon a broad cross section of the topics covered in this
course.

## Proposal

Email the instructor with an outline of your proposal. You will then meet with
the instructor to ensure that your proposed project has the right scope, and is
appropriate for the course; you may need to submit a revised proposal after this
meeting. You may begin this process at any point during the semester.
