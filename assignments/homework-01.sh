# Transform `homework-01.py` such that the function `pow` is renamed to `power`.
# Be sure to change all usages of the function in addition to its definition.
# Output the new version of the code to a file called `homework-01-modified.py`.
# You can verify that your changes are correct by running the Python script
# using `python3 homework-01-modified.py`, which should complete successfully.

# For debugging purposes, we might want to print the values we return from each
# function in our Python script. Above each return statement, add a line that
# prints the value that will be returned. Use Sed to do this. Keep in mind that
# the indentation will need to match that of the return statement.
# For example:
#
# return 1 + foo    -->    print(1 + foo)
#                          return 1 + foo
