# Homework 0

See Moodle for the due date.

Now that we've learned a little about the Unix shell, let's use what we've
learned. Download the [template script](homework-00.sh) and add a command to
produce the desired result for each of the tasks described. Once you're
finished, you can submit the script file through Moodle.

There isn't necessarily one correct answer, so feel free to use Google or man
pages (remember `man <command>`).
